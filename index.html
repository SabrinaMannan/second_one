    <p>Dumbledoreâ€™s death was the Red Wedding moment for Harry Potter fans. Nothing as emotionally devastating as this in any other HP book.</p>

    <p>
        The Half-blood prince was the only movie that I watched earlier than I read the book. And movie was generally pretty boring but it left me with tears. Dumbledore is my favorite character of HP and watching him die left me depressed for many days. There's no words in English language that can describe how much I hated Snape at that point. I even had a theory that the only time Harry would use Avada Kedavra would be on Snape. 
Dumbledore gave this story a sense of protection, safety, he was the one to make Hogwarts a shining city on a hill while everything else was consumed with Second Magical War and with his death it was over. 
RIP PROFFESOR ALBUS PERSIVAL WULFRIC BRYAN DUMBLEDORE
